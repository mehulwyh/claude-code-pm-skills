## Usage

Each skill is triggered with a `/command`:

```
/prd A tool that helps PMs prioritize features using AI-assisted scoring

/product-teardown Notion

/ab-test-design Moving the CTA button above the fold on the pricing page

/feedback-analyzer /path/to/customer-feedback.csv

/decision-doc Should we build our own auth system or use Auth0?
```

Skills auto-detect context. If you paste a CSV and ask Claude to analyze feedback, it may trigger `/feedback-analyzer` automatically.

## Design principles

- **Opinionated, not generic.** Each skill pushes back on vague inputs and forces specificity.
- **1-2 pages max.** Density over length. No 20-page PRDs.
- **PM workflows, not prompts.** These are multi-step processes with structured outputs — not one-shot prompts you could type yourself.
- **Plug and play.** No dependencies. No API keys. Copy the folder, use the skill.
